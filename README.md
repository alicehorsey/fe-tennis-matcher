# Tennis Match App

## Northcoders Graduation Project
Tennis Match App is a mobile app that allows players to find a tennis partner without having to join a club. They can set preferences such as distance from current location, ability, or age to filter the number of potential matches displayed and message anyone they are interested in playing a game with. To set up a profile, players must upload a photo and provide some user details. They then receive a stack of photos on all players that match their search criteria.
Happy swiping, we hope you find your tennis match!
